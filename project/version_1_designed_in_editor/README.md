# Bad Chess - version 1, designed in the editor

This project contains the source code and data for the "Bad Chess" toy after doing only the 1st part of the corresponding article, https://castle-engine.io/bad-chess/castle_game_engine_bad_chess_1.html .

So it contains the chessboard and pieces, designed in the editor, and some physics fun. But no code yet.

See the `version_2_with_code` subdirectory for the next version. That shows the end result after the 2nd article part, https://castle-engine.io/bad-chess/castle_game_engine_bad_chess_2.html .

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).
